# Smart-Tic-Tac-Toe

It's a Tic Tac Toe with AI. 
Compluter will play with you and will give optimal output. 
I have used a series of if else statement to check every possible vicotry and to stop opponents vicotry.
I know it's a tedious program but I have used comments to explain eveything.
Its a lenghty code so read from main to understand it.
Just give it a whirl you will enjoy it.

Hint to win: start in the middle else you won't win.
